</div>

<p>Please also see the README file distributed with this plugin, and for details on how to wrap the following functions in conditionals so your theme will only rely on this plugin when it is activated, please see the plugin page at: <a href="http://counsellingresource.com/features/2009/01/27/threaded-comment-numbering-plugin-for-wordpress/">Greg's Threaded Comment Numbering plugin</a>.</p>

<h4>Basic Usage</h4>
<p>Replace <code>wp_list_comments()</code> in your theme's <code>comments.php</code> file with <code>wp_list_comments('callback=gtcn_basic_callback')</code>.</p>

<h4>Advanced Usage</h4>
<p>Create your own callback function to display comments how you would like them, and insert <code>echo gtcn_comment_numbering($comment->comment_ID, $args)</code> within the callback function wherever you would like the comment number to appear. For custom styling, the function can also take an optional third parameter which defines the <code>class</code> of the <code>div</code> used to wrap the comment number. The default class is <code>commentnumber</code></p>

<h3>Built-In Theme Support for Comment Numbering</h3>

<p>Please consider asking your theme developer to support this plugin out of the box: with the addition of just a single line of code, most themes can be ready to display hierarchical comment numbering as soon as this plugin is activated!</p>
